This program takes user input for a city and returns weather information

From the project root, activate your virtual environment and run the command `python3 main.py`

You will be prompted to enter a city name, then the program will respond with a fun and interesting response using real-time weather data for that city!

If you really want to get creative, feel free to edit the `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` variable in the `create_response.py` file to tweak how you'd like the weather responses to be.

Enjoy!
